# End of Term Revision Project: Fantasy Great British Bake-Off League! 

 

The Great British Bake-Off (GBBO) is a British competition show where, over the course of several weeks, contestants show of their baking prowess in front of a panel of judges in the hopes of not being eliminated that week. 

You task, should you choose to accept, is to work together to develop a Java program that will help facilitate a fantasy league abased on the outcomes of the competition. 

Each participant (player) in the league will choose three contestants to be part of their fantasy team. Each week, the contestants will be awarded points based on what happens in the show. The winner of the league is the player with the most points at the end of the television season (NOT necessarily the players who picked the contested that won the show). 

The league’s data and history will be stored in a csv file called “Fantasy GBBO.csv”. 

Players will take turns at the console each week, entering their predictions. 

The actual outcomes will be provided in a csv file each week. 

Predictions and the associated points are detailed in the appendix. 

Ideally, there should be a menu system to help players navigate the system. 

Ideally, a player should be able to see a list of all the players and their cumulative point total so far. 

Ideally, a player should be able to see their own history of predictions and point scoring. 

The team should work with a common GitHub repository.
